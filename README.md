## Project description

Try the app, [click here!](https://pub-quiz-buddy-app.herokuapp.com/)

Pub Quiz Buddy is a team project which was built over 6 days. The app allows the user to interact with the map to find pub quizzes around Edinburgh, Scotland. Quizzes are displayed on the map as markers and can be clicked to view more details of that pub/quiz. The user can also filter to show quizzes on a specific week day (All quizzes shown by default). If the user wishes to, they can also add a pub quiz to the map if not already there.

## Tech used

- Front-end: Vue.js
- Back-end: Express.js
- Database: mongoDB
- Google maps/Google Places API

## Features I'd like to add

- Add more filters, such as if pub is dog friendly
- Extend pub quizzes outside of Edinburgh
- Add more rich data via new external APIs
- Make the app responsive
